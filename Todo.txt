Use cases:
1.  USB PPS adapter (MAX77958 manages USB) + MAX17330 (manages 1 battery charging)
    a.  Use MAX77958 to detect USB type
    b.  If PPS type then regulate the USB voltage based on MAX17330 charging status (Dropout, or power/heat limit)
    c.  If Type C - PD set to 5V leave it alone
    d.  If TYpe C (normal) or BC1.2 leave it at 5V
    e.  If charger is disconnected, reset settings, and start manangent again when charger connected
2.  Parallel Battery (MAX77818 to manage USB --> 1S battery voltage) + 2x MAX17330
    a.  Use MAX77818 to buck down the voltage and have MAX17330 regulate each battery current
    b.  Use MAX77958 to detect USB type
    c.  If PPS type, then set Input voltage to limit of MAX77818
    d.  If Type C - PD set to maximum voltage (9V or 12V are common values)  below 14V
    d.  If TYpe C (normal) or BC1.2 try to increase voltage to 9V or 12V
    e.  If charger is disconnected, reset settings, and start manangent again when charger connected
